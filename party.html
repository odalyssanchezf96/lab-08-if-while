<!-- Write a program that acts for user input… and counts down from that number to exactly 1. After it counts down to 1, it says “PARTY TIME!!!”.

say - “Let’s party…”
ask for a number: “How long ‘til the party?”
based on the input, it should count down from that number to 1
remember to convert from a string to an int!
if the number that is input is less than 1, then say “PARTY NOW!!!”
at the end, say “PARTY TIME!!!” -->
